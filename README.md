## About
TerraScoring Mars is a web app that allows Terraforming Mars players to select custom Milestone and Award 
pairs for their play session. Once pairs are selected, users can generate a printout with the Milestones and Awards 
to place on their game board. The app also tracks the synergy rating of the selected pairs to give users 
an idea of how balanced the game will be with the selected pairs. The synergy values are based on the community made 
synergy ratings found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PIUzO9XLF-MHSrTDP9QU2VW3ce7hJNciAR-G7N-RBUA/edit#gid=330638583).
